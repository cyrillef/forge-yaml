  x-summary: Asynchronous Javascript/Node.js library for the Autodesk Forge Model Derivative API
  description: |
    The Model Derivative API enables users to represent and share their designs in different formats, as well as to extract valuable metadata. (Its translation functionality was previously bundled as part of the “View and Data API”.)

    The API offers the following features:

    * Quickly translate the design into different formats, such as STL and OBJ.
    * Translate designs into SVF format for extracting data and for rendering files in the Viewer.
    * Extract object heirarchy trees, properties, and geometries of selected parts of a design.
    * Create different-sized thumbnails from design files.

    Get started by taking a look at our Step-by-Step Tutorials to see typical Model Derivative API workflows. The API Basics and Field Guide sections will help you understand the high-level concepts, and the API Reference section will give you the information you need to refine and create your own custom flows.

        Returns an up-to-date list of Forge-supported translations, that you can use to identify which types of derivatives are supported for each source file type. You can set this endpoint to only return the list of supported translations if they have been updated since a specified date.

        See the [Supported Translation Formats table](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/overview/supported-translations) for more details about supported translations.

        Note that we are constantly adding new file formats to the list of Forge translations.

      description: |
        Returns information about derivatives that correspond to a specific source file, including derviative URNs and statuses.

        The URNs of the derivatives are used to download the generated derivatives when calling the [GET {urn}/manifest/{derivativeurn}](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/urn-manifest-derivativeurn-GET) endpoint.

        The statuses are used to verify whether the translation of requested output files is complete.

        Note that different output files might complete their translation processes at different times, and therefore may have different `status` values.

        When translating a source file a second time, the previously created manifest is not deleted; it appends the information (only new translations) to the manifest.

        Downloads a selected derivative. To download the file, you need to specify the file’s URN, which you retrieve by calling the [GET {urn}/manifest](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/urn-manifest-GET) endpoint.

        Note that the Model Derivative API uses 2 types of URNs. The **design URN** is generated when you upload the source design file to Forge, and is used when calling most of the Model Derivative endpoints. A **derivative URN** is generated for each translated output file format, and is used for downloading the output design files.

        You can set the range of bytes that are returned when downloading the derivative, using the range header.
